Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to the field of Lingustics, as linguists use many types of data 
(judgements, audio, transcriptions, etc.). A linguist may be able to use, say for example, the grammar 
judgements of a speaker on a much larger scale, or find patterns not as easily detected by the human eye 
in audio files.
